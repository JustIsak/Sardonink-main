## About Me

Hi, I'm Isaac. Thanks for visiting my site. I have over 10 cumulative years of international design, writing, and teaching experience. I've worked with small garage-based engineering firms, city and federal governmental organizations, and the occasional lemonade stand. While working with those partners, Iâ€™ve led projects, managed teams, edited documents, and designed content. I'm passionate about clean minimalist design, split infinitives, and sandwiches of all shapes and sizes. Feel free to look through my portfolio to get an idea of my design philosophy; my resume to understand my background; or just contact me if you want to know anything else.
