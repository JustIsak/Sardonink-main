## About Me

I have over 10 cumulative years of international design, writing, and teaching experience. I've teamed with small garage-based engineering firms, city and federal governmental organizations, and the occasional lemonade stand. Iâ€™ve led projects, managed teams, designed and edited content, and coded feverishly into the night. I'm passionate about clean minimalist design, split infinitives, and sandwiches of all shapes and sizes. 

I'm currently based out of the **Shillin district in Taipei, Taiwan** and am actively looking for local clients to partner with. Feel free to look through my portfolio to get an idea of my design philosophy; my resume to understand my background; or just contact me if you want to know anything else.
